## Inspiration 🚀

The LED Chatbot project draws inspiration from the current climate of AI use in the classroom. Embracing the challenge of building a chatbot that utilizes only textbook information, we aimed to create a visually striking and innovative user experience by incorporating bright neon lights and colors into the design, due to the Hackathon theme.

## What it does 🌟

The chatbot is designed to extract information exclusively from a given textbook and provide relevant responses. We took textbook PDFs and transformed them into queryable values that our OpenAI calls can read from.

## How we built it 🛠️

Our journey was made possible by combining the power of React for the frontend, Flask for the backend API, and OpenAI API for intelligent responses. The NEON theme was implemented using vibrant colors and dynamic lighting effects, creating a visually stunning website. The Flask API handles communication between the frontend and OpenAI.

## Challenges we ran into 🤔

Ensuring that the chatbot maintains its functionality while incorporating the NEON theme required careful consideration of both technical and aesthetic aspects. Using Docker containers to separate the two sides of the project gave us difficulties with communication. These technologies were new to most of our group members, and we spent a lot of time debugging.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🎉

We're immensely proud of successfully blending advanced technologies such as React, Flask, and OpenAI into a cohesive and visually appealing chatbot. The project represents a seamless fusion of functionality and aesthetics, achieving a balance between information retrieval and an engaging user experience.

## What we learned 🧠

Our journey involved learning new technologies, integrating them effectively, and creating a visually stunning user interface. We delved into the world of chatbot development, React, Flask, Docker, and OpenAI API, gaining valuable insights into the interplay of technology and design in creating a compelling user experience.

## What's next for LED Chatbot 🚀

In the upcoming months, we plan to enhance the NEON theme by incorporating additional dynamic effects and interactivity. We aim to launch a limited edition of our NEON Textbook Chatbot, featuring exclusive features and improvements. Beyond this, we're excited to explore new ways to elevate the user experience and continue pushing the boundaries of NEON-themed projects.
